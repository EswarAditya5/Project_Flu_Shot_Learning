# Project_Flu_Shot_Learning

### The Project involves the following key steps:

**Data Collection: Driven Data:** https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step also involves transforming categorical variables into numerical representations, normalizing numeric features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.

**Model Training:** The procedure involves employing logistic regression with relevant libraries or frameworks to train the model. Training encompasses the adjustment of the model's parameters, such as coefficients, through the utilization of training data. The goal is to optimize the model's performance by minimizing the disparities between its predicted class labels and the actual class labels in the training dataset.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained logistic regression model involves using classification-specific evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC, and the confusion matrix, to gauge how well the model classifies and discriminates between different categories.
